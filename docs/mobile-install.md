# Mobile Install Guide (PWA)

HomeChronicle can be added to your home screen so it behaves like an app.

## Android (Chrome)

1. Open HomeChronicle in Chrome (example: `http://<server-ip>:3000`).
2. Tap the three-dot menu (`⋮`) in the top-right.
3. Tap **Install app** (or **Add to Home screen** on some versions).
4. Confirm by tapping **Install**.
5. Launch HomeChronicle from your home screen or app drawer.

## iPhone / iPad (Safari)

1. Open HomeChronicle in Safari (example: `http://<server-ip>:3000`).
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with an up arrow).
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**.
4. Optionally rename it, then tap **Add**.
5. Launch HomeChronicle from your home screen.

## Notes

- The app must be served over your local network or HTTPS (not from a file path).
- If install options do not appear, refresh once and try again.
- On iPhone, installation is supported from Safari; other iOS browsers may not show **Add to Home Screen** consistently.
